# Todo App v1 (the basics)

In this demo, we build a minimum viable 'Todo' app. It uses React and a simple
Store to let people add new todos and then mark them as done.

## Initialization

First, we pull in React, ReactDOM, and TinyBase:

```html
<script src="/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="/umd/tinybase/index.js"></script>
<script src="/umd/tinybase/ui-react/index.js"></script>
<script src="/umd/tinybase/ui-react-inspector/index.js"></script>
```

We're using the Inspector component for the purposes of seeing how the data is
structured.

We import the functions and components we need:

```js
const {createStore} = TinyBase;
const {
  CellView,
  Provider,
  TableView,
  useAddRowCallback,
  useCell,
  useCreateStore,
  useSetCellCallback,
} = TinyBaseUiReact;
const {useCallback, useState} = React;
const {Inspector} = TinyBaseUiReactInspector;
```

In this demo, we'll start with some sample data. We'll have a single Table,
called `todos`, that has three Row entries, each representing one todo:

```js
const INITIAL_TODOS = {
  todos: {
    0: {text: 'Clean the floor'},
    1: {text: 'Install TinyBase'},
    2: {text: 'Book holiday'},
  },
};
```

## The Top-Level `App` Component

We have a top-level `App` component, in which we create our Store object with
the sample data, and render the parts of the app. We use the useCreateStore
hook, since it provides memoization in case the component is rendered more than
once.

We _could_ drill the Store object as a React prop down to all the components,
but for clarity we wrap our app with the Provider component, which then makes it
available throughout our app as the default Store object:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const store = useCreateStore(() => createStore().setTables(INITIAL_TODOS));

  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Title />
      <NewTodo />
      <Todos />
      <Inspector />
    </Provider>
  );
};
```

We also added the Inspector component at the end there so you can inspect what
is going on with the data during this demo. Simply click the TinyBase logo in
the corner.

The app only has three components: `Title`, `NewTodo` (a form to enter a new
todo), and `Todos` (a list of all of the todos).

We use LESS to create a grid layout and some defaults for the app's styling:

```less
@accentColor: #d81b60;
@spacing: 0.5rem;
@border: 1px solid #ccc;
@font-face {
  font-family: Inter;
  src: url(https://tinybase.org/fonts/inter.woff2) format('woff2');
}

body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 35% minmax(0, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-family: Inter, sans-serif;
  letter-spacing: -0.04rem;
  grid-gap: @spacing * 2 @spacing;
  margin: 0;
  min-height: 100vh;
  padding: @spacing * 2;
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    outline-color: @accentColor;
  }
}
```

When the window loads, we render the `App` component to start the app:

```jsx
window.addEventListener('load', () =>
  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.body).render(<App />),
);
```

Let's look at each of three components that make up the app.

## The `Title` Component

There's not much to say about this component for now. It's just the title for
the app. We'll do more with this later!

```js
const Title = () => 'Todos';
```

## The `NewTodo` Component

This component lets the user add a new todo. It's a standard managed `input`
element that keeps the `text` of the input box in the component's state, and
also listens to key presses:

```jsx
const NewTodo = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const handleChange = useCallback(({target: {value}}) => setText(value), []);
  const handleKeyDown = useAddRowCallback(
    'todos',
    ({which, target: {value: text}}) =>
      which == 13 && text != '' ? {text} : null,
    [],
    undefined,
    () => setText(''),
    [setText],
  );

  return (
    <input
      id="newTodo"
      onChange={handleChange}
      onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}
      placeholder="New Todo"
      value={text}
    />
  );
};
```

The useAddRowCallback hook creates us a callback that is run whenever the user
presses a key. This lets us check if the key pressed was the Return key, and if
there's some text in the input box. If so, it adds a new todo Row to the default
Store object and then resets the form.

As an aside, it may seem like the useAddRowCallback hook has a lot of
parameters, since we are providing two functions, each with their own lists of
dependencies (which are used to memoize them). The first parameter is the Id of
the table to which we are adding a row. The second is the handler that takes the
event and produces the new row to be added and the third parameter is the list
of dependencies for that function (of which there are none). The fourth
parameter would allow us to explicitly specify which Store object to use, but
`undefined` gives us the app-wide default. The fifth parameter is a 'then'
callback which will run after the row has been added (which is where we can
reset the input field) and the sixth and final parameter is a list of
dependencies for that (of which there is only one, the function used to do that
setting of the input field text).

The input box also needs styling:

```less
#newTodo {
  border: @border;
  display: block;
  font: inherit;
  letter-spacing: inherit;
  padding: @spacing;
  width: 100%;
}
```

## The `Todos` Component

To get the list of todos, we build a very simple component, comprising the
TableView component right out of the box. We pass props to that component to
indicate that we will be rendering each Row of the `todos` Table. Since we are
not providing a `store` prop to the TableView, it will also use the default one
from the Provider component that we wrapped the whole app in:

```jsx
const Todos = () => (
  <ul id="todos">
    <TableView tableId="todos" rowComponent={Todo} />
  </ul>
);
```

The final `rowComponent` prop for the TableView component allows us to specify
how each Row is rendered. We will have our own `Todo` component (described
below) to do this.

Finally, we style this part of the app and position it in the grid:

```less
#todos {
  grid-column: 2;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

## The `Todo` Component

This simple `Todo` component renders a simple `div` containing the todo's `text`
that toggles the `done` flag when clicked. Each Row has two fields: the todo's
`text` and an optional boolean indicating whether it is `done` that we get using
the useCell hook.

We also create a simple `handleClick` callback that negates the `done` flag when
the text is clicked:

```jsx
const Todo = (props) => (
  <li className="todo">
    <TodoText {...props} />
  </li>
);

const TodoText = ({tableId, rowId}) => {
  const done = useCell(tableId, rowId, 'done');
  const className = 'text' + (done ? ' done' : '');
  const handleClick = useSetCellCallback(tableId, rowId, 'done', () => !done, [
    done,
  ]);

  return (
    <span className={className} onClick={handleClick}>
      <CellView tableId={tableId} rowId={rowId} cellId="text" />
    </span>
  );
};
```

**NB**: The parent TableView component passes its Store object as a prop to each
of its `rowComponent` children (such as this `TodoText`). We could have used
that prop here, but instead we're using the useSetCellCallback hook that will
automatically get it from the Provider component.

Finally, we style each of these todos, and use the `done` CSS class to strike
through those that are completed:

```less
#todos .todo {
  background: #fff;
  border: @border;
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: @spacing;
  padding: @spacing;
  .text {
    cursor: pointer;
    flex: 1;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    user-select: none;
    white-space: nowrap;
    &::before {
      content: '\1F7E0';
      padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0.25rem;
    }
    &.done {
      color: #ccc;
      &::before {
        content: '\2705';
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Summary

That's it: a simple Todo app made from a handful of tiny components, and less
than 100 lines of generously-formatted code.

Next, we will build a more complex viable 'Todo' app. Please continue to
