# Demos

This is a selection of demos that show how TinyBase can be used in real-world
applications.

[TinyRooms](https://github.com/tinyplex/tinyrooms) is a local-first app demo,
using TinyBase, PartyKit, and optional GitHub OAuth. It is designed to explore
the challenges of (and possible solutions for) building local-first apps in the
real world. You can try it out
[here](https://tinyrooms.jamesgpearce.partykit.dev).

For the demos on this site, we start with the obligatory 'Hello World' example,
and then advance from there. Some demos have multiple versions which start
simple and then gain additional functionality with subsequent iterations.

For a 'kitchen-sink' demo that shows TinyBase really being put through its
paces, take a look at the Drawing demo.

This set of demos should grow over time, so keep checking back!
