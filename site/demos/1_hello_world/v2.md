# Hello World v2

In this demo, we again set data in, and then get data from, a Store object. But
this time we're using tabular data.

[base]: # 'Hello World v1'

It's just a few changes to do so. Firstly we use the setCell method instead of
the setValue method:

```diff-js
-store.setValue('v1', 'Hello World');
+store.setCell('t1', 'r1', 'c1', 'Hello World');
```

As you can see, instead of setting the keyed Value called `v1`, we're putting
the data in a Cell called `c1`, in a Row called `r1`, in a Table called `t1`:

We also need to update the way in which we get the value back out again:

```diff-js
-document.body.innerHTML = store.getValue('v1');
+document.body.innerHTML = store.getCell('t1', 'r1', 'c1');
```

The result is the same but now hopefully you get a sense for how the keyed value
and tabular APIs to the Store are going to work.

Next, we will set up a listener for data in the Store object and then change the
Cell to see the display update. Please continue to the Hello World v3 demo.
