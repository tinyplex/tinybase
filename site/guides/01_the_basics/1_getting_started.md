# Getting Started

This guide gets you up and running quickly with TinyBase.

It is not intended to be a detailed introduction to installing JavaScript build-
and run-time environments! It assumes that you have (or know how to have) a
browser or Node-based development environment.

Note that TinyBase requires a reasonably modern environment, as it makes
extensive use of contemporary JavaScript features. A regularly-updated browser
and Node 16 (or above) are recommended. If you find you need older
compatibility, there are additional transpilations in the `lib/es6` folder of
the distribution.

Let's go!

## TinyBase from a template

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that makes it easy to get started
with modern web projects based on application templates. To use the TinyBase
template, firstly make a copy of it:

```sh
npx degit tinyplex/vite-tinybase my-tinybase-app
```

Then go into the directory, install the dependencies, and run the application:

```sh
cd my-tinybase-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The final step will display a local URL, which should serve up a basic TinyBase
application for you:

In fact, there are seven templates for TinyBase, depending on whether you want
to use TypeScript or React, and the integrations you want to target.
Instructions are available in the README of each:

| Template                                                                                       | Language   | React | Plus        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| [vite-tinybase](https://github.com/tinyplex/vite-tinybase)                                     | JavaScript | No    |             |
| [vite-tinybase-ts](https://github.com/tinyplex/vite-tinybase-ts)                               | TypeScript | No    |             |
| [vite-tinybase-react](https://github.com/tinyplex/vite-tinybase-react)                         | JavaScript | Yes   |             |
| [vite-tinybase-ts-react](https://github.com/tinyplex/vite-tinybase-ts-react)                   | TypeScript | Yes   |             |
| [vite-tinybase-ts-react-crsqlite](https://github.com/tinyplex/vite-tinybase-ts-react-crsqlite) | TypeScript | Yes   | CR-SQLite   |
| [tinybase-ts-react-partykit](https://github.com/tinyplex/tinybase-ts-react-partykit)           | TypeScript | Yes   | PartyKit    |
| [tinybase-ts-react-electricsql](https://github.com/tinyplex/tinybase-ts-react-electricsql)     | TypeScript | Yes   | ElectricSQL |

## TinyBase in a browser

Another simple way to get started with TinyBase is to include it as a UMD script
from a CDN in a web page. Create a file called `index.html`, for example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First TinyBase App</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/tinybase/lib/umd/tinybase.js"></script>
    <script>
      addEventListener('load', () => {
        const {createStore} = TinyBase;

        const store = createStore();
        store.setValue('v1', 'Hello');
        store.setCell('t1', 'r1', 'c1', 'World');

        document.body.innerHTML =
          store.getValue('v1') + ' ' + store.getCell('t1', 'r1', 'c1');
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body />
</html>
```

Open this file in your browser and you should see the words 'Hello World' on the
screen, each having been written to, and read from, a Store.

Note that the UMD script is pulled from NPM by the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com)
service. The script provides a global object from which you can destructure the
top-level functions of the API.

## TinyBase in a Node application

TinyBase is packaged on NPM, so you can easily install it as a dependency for
your application.

```bash
mkdir MyFirstTinyBaseApp
cd MyFirstTinyBaseApp
npm init -y
npm install tinybase
```

Create a file in this directory called `index.mjs`:

```js yolo
import {createStore} from 'tinybase';
const store = createStore();
store.setValue('v1', 'Hello');
store.setCell('t1', 'r1', 'c1', 'World');
console.log(store.getValue('v1') + ' ' + store.getCell('t1', 'r1', 'c1'));
```

Run this module script with:

```bash
node index.mjs
```

Again, you will see the words 'Hello World' on the screen, having each been
written to, and read from, a Store.

If that all worked, you are set up and ready to learn more about TinyBase! From
here on, we will mostly show Node-based code snippets, but most should be easily
translatable to run in a browser too.

Before we move on, you should be aware that the overall package includes a
number of different versions of TinyBase, transpiled for different targets and
formats. You may want to take a look at the Importing TinyBase guide if the code
above isn't working in your environment - React Native in particular.

Let's move onto the Creating A Store guide.
