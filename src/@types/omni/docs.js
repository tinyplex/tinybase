/**
 * This is a package containing every TinyBase module.
 *
 * Use this if you are importing multiple persisters or synchronizers, for
 * example, and you want to reduce duplication of their shared code.
 *
 * However, this approach assumes that you will tree-shake the resulting bundle
 * to remove the unused code of all the other persisters and synchronizers that
 * you do NOT use.
