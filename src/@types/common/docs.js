/**
 * The getUniqueId function returns a unique string of a given length.
 *
 * This is used internally by TinyBase for the synchronizer protocol and for
 * unique MergeableStore identifiers. But it is useful enough for it to be
 * publicly exposed for purposes such as identifying shared collaboration rooms,
 * or creating other Ids that need to be unique.
 *
 * The string may contain numbers, lower or upper case letters, or the '-' or
 * '_' characters. This makes them URL-safe, and means they can be identified
 * with a regex like `/[-_0-9A-Za-z]+/`.
 *
 * This function prefers to use the `crypto` module to generate random numbers,
 * but where that is not available (such as in React Native), a `Math.random`
 * implementation is used. Whilst that may not be cryptographically sound, it
 * should suffice for most TinyBase-related purposes.
 * @param length The desired length of the unique Id, defaulting to 16.
 * @returns A unique Id of the required length.
 * @example
 * This example creates two 8 character long Ids and compares them.
 *
 * ```js
 * import {getUniqueId} from 'tinybase';
 *
 * const id1 = getUniqueId(8);
 * const id2 = getUniqueId(8);

/**
 * The getHlcFunctions function returns a set of utility functions for working
 * with the TinyBase Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC).
 *
 * An HLC is a sortable 16 character string that encodes a timestamp, a counter,
 * and the hash of a unique client identifier. You should provide that unique
 * client identifier as the `uniqueId` parameter to the function. Otherwise it
 * will be defaulted and the client suffix of the HLCs the `getNextHlc` function
 * generates will be non-deterministic.
 *
 * You can also provide a `getNow` function that returns the current time in
 * milliseconds, which is useful for testing purposes where fully deterministic
 * HLCs are required, rather than the current time.
 *
 * The stateful functions returned by this function are as follows.
 *
 * - `getNextHlc`: a function that returns the next HLC for this client based on
 *   the time and any other HLC values from other clients that have been seen.
 * - `seenHlc`: a function that takes an HLC and updates the internal state of
 *   the functions to ensure that the next HLC returned by `getNextHlc` is
 *   greater than the given seen HLC.
 * - `encodeHlc`: a function that takes a timestamp, a counter (and optionally a
 *   different `clientId`) and encodes the them into an HLC string.
 * - `decodeHlc`: a function that takes an HLC and returns an array containing
 *   the logical time, counter, and client Id parts.
 * - `getLastLogicalTime`: a function that returns the last logical time either
 *   generated or seen by this client.
 * - `getLastCounter`: a function that returns the last counter either generated
 *   or seen by this client.
 * - `getClientId`: a function that returns the client Id for this client;
 *   either uniquely generated or derived from the `uniqueId` parameter.
 * @param uniqueId An optional unique Id for the client.
 * @param getNow An optional function that generates millisecond timestamps,
 * defaulting to `Date.now`.
 * @returns An array of seven stateful functions as described above.
 * @category Stamps
 * @since v6.2.0
 * @example
 * This example gets the HLC functions (for a given client Id and a fixed time;
 * both for illustrative purposes), and then uses them:
 *
 * ```js
 * import {getHlcFunctions} from 'tinybase';
 *
 * const [
 *   getNextHlc,
 *   seenHlc,
 *   encodeHlc,
 *   decodeHlc,
 *   getLastLogicalTime,
 *   getLastCounter,
 *   getClientId,
 * ] = getHlcFunctions('client1', () => 73267200000); // This client is in 1972.
 *
 * // Generate an HLC based on the fixed time and the client Id.
 * console.log(getNextHlc());
 * // -> '03E3B------mmxrx'
 *
 * // Generate the next HLC. The time has not changed, so the counter does.
 * console.log(getNextHlc());
 * // -> '03E3B-----0mmxrx'
 *
 * // Another client thinks it is 1973.
 * seenHlc('0WakTk-----jmx_3');
 * // Generate the next HLC.
 *
 * // What is the state for the current client?
 * console.log(getLastLogicalTime());
 * // -> 104803200000
 * console.log(getLastCounter());
 * // -> 0
 * console.log(getClientId());
 * // -> 'mmxrx'
 *
 * // Encode an arbitrary HLC.
 * console.log(encodeHlc(73267203600, 7, 'client3'));
 * // -> '03E3BsF---6kmxfM'
 *
 * // Decode it again.
 * console.log(decodeHlc('03E3BsF---6kmxfM'));
 * // -> [73267203600, 7, 'kmxfM']
