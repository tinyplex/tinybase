/**
 * The persisters module of the TinyBase project provides a simple framework for
 * saving and loading Store data, to and from different destinations, or
 * underlying storage types.
 *
 * Several entry points are provided, each of which returns a new Persister
 * object that can load and save a Store:
 *
 * - The createSessionPersister function returns a Persister that uses the
 *   browser's session storage.
 * - The createLocalPersister function returns a Persister that uses the
 *   browser's local storage.
 * - The createRemotePersister function returns a Persister that uses a remote
 *   server.
 * - The createFilePersister function returns a Persister that uses a local file
 *   (in an appropriate environment).
 *
 * Since persistence requirements can be different for every app, the
 * createCustomPersister function can also be used to easily create a fully
 * customized way to save and load Store data.

/**
 * A Persister object lets you save and load Store data to and from different
 * locations, or underlying storage types.
 *
 * This is useful for preserving Store data between browser sessions or reloads,
 * saving or loading browser state to or from a server, or saving Store data to
 * disk in a environment with filesystem access.
 *
 * Creating a Persister depends on the choice of underlying storage where the
 * data is to be stored. Options include the createSessionPersister function,
 * the createLocalPersister, the createRemotePersister function, and the
 * createFilePersister function. The createCustomPersister function can also be
 * used to easily create a fully customized way to save and load Store data.
 *
 * A Persister lets you explicit save or load data, with the save method and the
 * load method respectively. These methods are both asynchronous (since the
 * underlying data storage may also be) and return promises. As a result you
 * should use the `await` keyword to call them in a way that guarantees
 * subsequent execution order.
 *
 * When you don't want to deal with explicit persistence operations, a Persister
 * object also provides automatic saving and loading. Automatic saving listens
 * for changes to the Store and persists the data immediately. Automatic loading
 * listens (or polls) for changes to the persisted data and reflects those
 * changes in the Store.
 *
 * You can start automatic saving or loading with the startAutoSave method and
 * startAutoLoad method. Both are asynchronous since they will do an immediate
 * save and load before starting to listen for subsequent changes. You can stop
 * the behavior with the stopAutoSave method and stopAutoLoad method (which are
 * synchronous).
 *
 * You may often want to have both automatic saving and loading of a Store so
 * that changes are constantly synchronized (allowing basic state preservation
 * between browser tabs, for example). The framework has some basic provisions
 * to prevent race conditions - for example it will not attempt to save data if
 * it is currently loading it and vice-versa.
 *
 * Be aware, however, that the default implementations do not provide complex
 * synchronization heuristics and you should comprehensively test your
 * persistence strategy to understand the opportunity for data loss (in the case
 * of trying to save data to a server under poor network conditions, for
 * example).
 *
 * @example
 * This example creates a Store, persists it to the browser's session storage as
 * a JSON string, changes the persisted data, updates the Store from it, and
 * finally destroys the Persister again.
 *
 * ```js
 * const store = createStore().setTables({pets: {fido: {species: 'dog'}}});
 * const persister = createSessionPersister(store, 'pets');
 *
 * await persister.save();
 * console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('pets'));
 * // -> '[{"pets":{"fido":{"species":"dog"}}},{}]'
 *
 * sessionStorage.setItem('pets', '[{"pets":{"toto":{"species":"dog"}}},{}]');
 * await persister.load();
 * console.log(store.getTables());
 * // -> {pets: {toto: {species: 'dog'}}}
 *
 * persister.destroy();
 * sessionStorage.clear();
 * ```
 * @example
 * This example creates a Store, and automatically saves and loads it to the
 * browser's session storage as a JSON string. Changes to the Store data, or the
 * persisted data (implicitly firing a StorageEvent), are reflected accordingly.
 *
 * ```js
 * const store = createStore();
 * const persister = createSessionPersister(store, 'pets');
 *
 * await persister.startAutoLoad({pets: {fido: {species: 'dog'}}});
 * await persister.startAutoSave();
 *
 * store.setTables({pets: {felix: {species: 'cat'}}});
 * // ...
 * console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('pets'));
 * // -> '[{"pets":{"felix":{"species":"cat"}}},{}]'
 *
 * // In another browser tab:
 * sessionStorage.setItem('pets', '[{"pets":{"toto":{"species":"dog"}}},{}]');
 * // -> StorageEvent('storage', {storageArea: sessionStorage, key: 'pets'})
 *
 * // ...
 * console.log(store.getTables());
 * // -> {pets: {toto: {species: 'dog'}}}
 *
