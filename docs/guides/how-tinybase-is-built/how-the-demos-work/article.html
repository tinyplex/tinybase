It contains a guide that explains each part of the demo step-by-step, whether HTML, JavaScript, or LESS. And then at the top of the page, the demo actually runs.</p><p>Rather than trying to keep prose and running demo in sync, something interesting here is that the code <em>in</em> the guide is exactly what is compiled together at build time to create the running demo.</p><p>Basically all of the code from the guide is concatenated together into a single file: the HTML snippets at the start, then the JavaScript snippets inline, and then the LESS (processed into CSS) inline as styles. THe resulting &#x27;single-file&#x27; HTML is then minified and attached to an iframe (via the <code>srcdoc</code> attribute) so that it is nicely sandboxed.</p><p>When a demo is an enhancement to an existing one (such as the <a href="/demos/todo-app/todo-app-v2-indexes/">Todo App v2 (indexes)</a> demo), the guide will contain diffs. These are also actively applied to the previous code. It&#x27;s a little tricky to make sure the diffs always apply cleanly when you update preceding demo guides, but it reduces repetition.</p><p>Finally, some client-side JavaScript makes it possible to launch the demos into CodePen via their pre-fill API.</p></section>
