This guide runs through the main file structure and principles.</p><p>The top level directory contains lots of configuration files: for the package as a whole (<code>package.json</code>), for Jest (<code>jest.config.js</code>), for Prettier (<code>.prettierrc</code>) and for ESLint (<code>.eslintrc.json</code>). TypeScript configuration is <em>not</em> in the top-level directory, but is co-located with the <code>src</code> and <code>test</code> files independently.</p><p><code>gulpfile.mjs</code> is an important file, since it describes all the build steps for the project, many of which are described in the <a href="/guides/how-tinybase-is-built/developing-tinybase/">Developing TinyBase</a> guide.</p><h3 id="src">src</h3><p>The main source code is in the top-level <code>src</code> directory, where there is a pair of files for each major module: the <code>.d.ts</code> files in the <code>@types</code> folder containing the Typescript definitions (and the source of truth for the documentation), and the <code>.ts</code> file containing the main logic.</p><p>Most modules have a similar pattern: a single creation function (such as the <a href="/api/store/functions/creation/createstore/"><code>createStore</code></a> function in the case of the <a href="/api/store/"><code>store</code></a> module), and a major interface that the returned object conforms to (such as the <a href="/api/store/interfaces/store/store/"><code>Store</code></a> interface).</p><p>As well as those, there are a set of common functions and utilities in the <code>common</code> subdirectory, implementations used by the <a href="/api/persisters/"><code>persisters</code></a> module in the <code>persisters</code> subdirectory, and hooks and components for the <a href="/api/ui-react/"><code>ui-react</code></a> module in the <code>ui-react</code> subdirectory.</p><p>There is a top-level <code>tinybase.d.ts</code> and <code>tinybase.ts</code> pair to wrap everything together into a single convenient package: these contain just imports.</p><h3 id="test">test</h3><p>There are Jest unit tests for all modules in the <code>unit</code> subdirectory. The <code>perf</code> subdirectory contains the performance tests. The <code>e2e</code> subdirectory contains Puppeteer tests for checking all the demos on the website work.</p><p>The <code>jest</code> subdirectory contains some extensions that allow <a href="/">TinyBase</a> to do things like count and report the total number of assertions.</p><p>There is more about <a href="/">TinyBase</a>&#x27;s testing in the following <a href="/guides/how-tinybase-is-built/testing/">Testing</a> guide.</p><h3 id="site">site</h3><p>This is the folder containing content and assets required for the <a href="/">TinyBase</a> website. <code>demos</code> and <code>guides</code> subdirectories are self-explanatory and contain markdown files for site pages.</p><p>The <code>ui</code> folder contains some React components that are server-side rendered at build time to populate the <code>docs</code> directory which is used as a straightforward GitHub pages deployment.</p><p>API documentation comes from the <code>.d.ts</code> files by way of the TinyDocs library (which is essentially a custom wrapper around TypeDoc). Other static assets like CSS and JS are built into the final site from other folders in this directory.</p><h3 id="dist">dist</h3><p>Not checked in, but distributed via NPM, is a <code>dist</code> directory, which contains the <code>.d.ts</code> type definitions, the compiled <code>.js</code> files, and their compressed <code>.js.gz</code> equivalents. The <code>exports</code> field of the <code>package.json</code> wire everything together into the right place when people use the library.</p><p>These build configurations are all defined in the <code>compileForProd</code> task in <code>gulpfile.mjs</code>, and instructions for importing them are in the <a href="/guides/the-basics/importing-tinybase/">Importing TinyBase</a> guide.</p></section>
