For example, in a Todo app, you can imagine using a <a href="/api/store/type-aliases/store/row/"><code>Row</code></a> in a <a href="/api/store/type-aliases/store/table/"><code>Table</code></a> for each todo. TinyBase makes it easy to set, get, respond to, and enumerate over this data and build user interfaces with it.</p><p>Generally TinyBase will be appropriate for use in a client-side application such as a browser or rich web site where size and performance are a premium, and you want some of the boilerplate for managing tabular data structures taken care of.</p><h3 id="why-should-i-use-tinybase">Why Should I Use TinyBase?</h3><p>You don&#x27;t have to! There are many state management solutions for React and JavaScript applications. Many are more mature than TinyBase and have different (sometimes magical) approaches for dealing with reactivity.</p><p>TinyBase models how <em>I</em> think about building applications, and I could not find any existing solutions that provided the mix of structure, reactivity, small footprint, and functionality that I imagined. TinyBase was born!</p><p>Maybe you share similar thoughts, and TinyBase will click with you. Maybe you don&#x27;t and it won&#x27;t. That&#x27;s OK!</p><h3 id="when-should-i-not-use-tinybase">When Should I Not Use TinyBase?</h3><p>While it may be appropriate to use TinyBase in a server environment, it does not replace a fully-fledged database system. But there are plenty of options for integrating with databases like SQLite and Postgres.</p><h3 id="can-i-contribute-to-tinybase">Can I Contribute To TinyBase?</h3><p>Yes! You are very welcome to contribute to this project, though it is a spare-time endeavor so there is no guarantee around speed or certainty of contributions being accepted.</p><p>Please follow the formatting mandated by the Prettier and ESLint config and just ensure that test coverage remains at 100%!</p><h3 id="are-there-good-examples-of-tinybase-in-use">Are There Good Examples Of TinyBase In Use?</h3><p>Please see the <a href="/demos/">demos</a> for ideas!</p><h3 id="what-if-i-have-other-questions">What If I Have Other Questions?</h3><p>Please open a pull request or issue on GitHub and ask!
